# 3D-vis-reasoning

A stero vision-based 3D reconstruction and Recognition System,
originally developed under the scope of ECE188, Spring 2023, UCLA.

## Data Processing

Denoise the input image data, with the following tools:
1. automatically detect the most relavent noise types in the images;
2. use corresponding denoising algorithms to remove the noise effect;

## 3D scene Reconstruction with 2D images

## 3D point cloud Recognition
